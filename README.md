# ALX ProDev Backend Web Development

# ProDev Backend Engineering Program Overview
<p>The program was focused on Advanced Backend. Therefore most of the tasks and concepts required an prior understanding of Backend Web Development.</p>
<p>The program divided deeper into deployment, testing, containerization among other concepts that are required to bring the web application to life and accessible to the outside world.</p>
<p>The program also help us understand the benefits of creating monthly worklogs and importance of peer collaboration. </p>

# Key technologies covered:
1. Advanced SQL: for making advanced queries, indexing and optimazation.
2. Python: we solidified our understanding on generators, decorators, context managers and asynchronous programming.
3. Django: we enhanced our understanding of the framework with some advanced concepts such as middlewares and signals.
4. Shell: we learnt the basics and advanced concepts of shell.
5. Docker: we learnt and implemented the basics of docker.
6. Kubernetes: Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides the orchestration needed to manage containerized apps at scale.
7. GraphQL: GraphQL is a powerful query language and runtime for APIs, developed by Facebook, that allows clients to request exactly the data they need — nothing more, nothing less. Unlike REST APIs, which return fixed data structures, GraphQL gives clients the flexibility to shape the response format.
8. CI/CD pipelines: This concept page introduced CI/CD principles and walks through setting up pipelines using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitHub Actions, managing environments, and incorporating feedback loops.

# Challenges faced:
* Working with docker.
* Keeping up with my monthly worklogs.
* Implementing some concepts learnt.

# Solutions Implemented:
* Updating monthly worklogs to fit my schedules.
* Doing more research and watching tutorials on the challenging concepts.
* Understanding docker from scratch and doing minimal tasks with it to get a grasp of its functionality.

# Best practices and personal takeaways:
1. Ask for help when stuck.
2. Be open to feedback.
3. Keep challenging myself to make it.
